# WELCOME!
I have a Master's Degree in Applied Data Science (2023) and Applied Physics (2014).  
- This site has been designed to enable others to get a sense of the quality of my work.  If focuses primarily on Applied Data Science but I also included a section for my 2014 Applied Physics Thesis as well.

## Philosophies:
### Data Science:
When it comes to Data Science I am a strong proponent of using the CRISP-DM methodology.  The reason I favor the CRISP-DM method is the clear and necessary step of making sure that a Data Science Project or effort is firmly grounded in the Business Understanding.  Being able to make accurate predictions is great but it has to be tied to a business objective or the data is not reaching its full potential.

### Programming:
I believe doing so in a way that is ultimately efficient, reliable, and maintainable.  In addition, a programmer should play to the strengths of the particular language they are using.
- Efficient:  Using the minimal computational resources necessary to complete the computation.
- Reliable:  Ensuring it works even if errors are in the data.  This often requires making sure the program can identify common errors in the data, notify the user, and respond appropriately.  Minor errors, especially with human entry, are common so the code should have some error checking built in so it does not crash over a minor mistake.
- Maintainable:  Others should be able to read my code, understand what it is doing, how it is doing it, and make modifications as necessary.  The proper applications of comments in the code is critical.
- Unique Program Stengths:  I have programmed in MatLab, Python, R, Java, and Visual Basic.  Each language has pros and cons and has unique features associated with it.  Those unique features offer advantages that should be fully taken advantage of.

### Physics
The difference between a good physicist and a great physicist is this:  A good physicist can see the difference between doing a problem right and doing it wrong.  A great physicist can see the difference between right and almost right.

### Better Today / Even Better Tomorrow!:
Constant improvement is essential in work and in life.  Being your best takes effort, discipline, and the desire to do better in the future.  

# Closing Remarks:
I hope you find this page useful.  It has been organized via repositories.  Each repository gives details on the course, assignments, and significant projects I completed.
