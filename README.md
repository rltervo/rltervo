# WELCOME!
I have a Master's Degree in Applied Data Science (2023) and Applied Physics (2014).  
- This site has been designed to enable others to get a sense of the quality of my work.  If focuses primarily on the Applied Data Science but I did add a section for the 2014 Applied Physics Thesis.

## Philosophies:
### Data Science and Programming:
When it comes to Data Science I am a strong proponent of using the CRISP-DM methodology.  Many data science methods are similar but the part that I believe is a bit unique with CRISP-DM is the clear and necessary step of making sure what we are doing is grounded in the Business Understanding.  Being able to make accurate predictions is great but it has to be tied to a business objective or the data is reaching its full potential.

### Programming:
I believe doing so in a way that is ultimately efficient, reliable, and maintainable.
- Efficient:  Using the minimal computational resources necessary to complete the computation.
- Reliable:  Ensuring it works even if errors are in the data.  This often requires making sure the program can identify common errors in the data and
- Maintainable:  Others should be able to read my code, understand what it is doing, how it is doing it, and make modifications as necessary.

I hope you find this page useful.
